    <h3>Recipe Tip:</h3>
    <ul>
        For easy cleanup and less mess, mix Parmesan mixture in a long flat-lidded plastic to-go container. Place one chop in at a time, snap the lid, and shake. Transfer coated chop to a plate and repeat with remaining chops. Perfectly coated chops every single time!
